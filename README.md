#### What is RainJacket?
***RainJacket*** helps users figure out what to wear
depending on their gender, the event they are attending and the current weather conditions.

The story behind the app... My girlfriend always asks me what the weather is like while she is getting ready. She then takes that tempeature and thinks of what she should wear to suit her day / evening. She constantly stressed to me that her biggest problem when getting ready was deciding what to wear based on where she was going. I took her problem and made a simple solution that anyone can use.

One of the things I really wanted to empliment was a user sourced app that allows users to grow the database while helping other users. The file upload function adds the photo to the users profile and saves it to the database with the input values so that other users will be able to use it for inspiration when the search.
